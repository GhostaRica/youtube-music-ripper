# Usage
### Recommended: Use the launcher script

Instead of running `main.py` directly, run the launcher script:

```bash
python launcher.py <youtube_link> [options]
```

The launcher script will:

* Automatically check for and download the latest version of the downloader script from GitHub
* Save the latest commit info
* Then run `main.py` with all the arguments you provide

### Optional: Run `main.py` directly

If you want to **bypass the launcher‚Äôs auto-update functionality**, this is useful incase the machine you are running this on doesn't have git installed this way you can run the downloader script directly:

```bash
python main.py <youtube_link> [options]
```

However, running the launcher is recommended to always keep your downloader script up to date.
Once everything is set up, run the script with a YouTube URL:

### Example:

```bash
python main.py https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
```

# üìÅ Output

The downloaded file(s) will be saved in the downloads folder located in the same directory as `main.py`, or as specified in the script.

* Download the highest-quality audio or video
* Convert the format (e.g. to MP3)
* Add metadata like title, artist, or thumbnail

# Deactivation

When you‚Äôre done, you can deactivate the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```
